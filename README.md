### 2. **Hand Tracking Interaction (HandC)**

This game (WIP) integrates **OpenCV**, **Mediapipe**, and **Three.js** for gesture-based interactions using your computer's camera. You control the player by moving your hand left or right and jumping by closing your hand.

#### Current Features:

- **Hand Tracking**: Detects and tracks hand gestures in real-time using Mediapipe and OpenCV.
- **Controls**:
  - Move Left/Right: Move your hand left or right in the camera view.
  - Jump: Close your hand to trigger a jump.

#### How to Test:

1. Open the **EndlessCubeRunnerHandC** folder.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** (if using Visual Studio Code) or serve it through your preferred local web server.
3. Run the `handsLandmarksClick.py` script in your terminal:
   - Ensure your camera is enabled and permissions are granted.
   - Keep your hand in the view of the camera to interact with the game.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering and animations.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and hand detection.
- **Mediapipe**: Real-time gesture recognition.

## Future Goals

- Expand **Endless Cube Runner** with more dynamic obstacles and levels.
- Complete the **HandC** game by integrating gesture-based movement and actions fully.
- Add support for mobile devices with touchscreen gestures.

## User Instructions for Hand Tracking Script

1. Run the `handsLandmarksClick.py` file in your terminal.
2. Your camera will open up. Place your hand in view of the camera.
3. The system will recognize and track your hand movements:
   - **Index Tip (12)** and **Index Bottom (9)** positions are tracked.
   - If the tip (12) is lower than the bottom (9) in the screen's X,Y coordinates, the system detects a change.
4. To quit the application, press **Q**.
